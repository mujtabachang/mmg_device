##Mechanomyogram Device for Gesture Detection##

**Hardware assisted gesture detection app**

Mechanmyogram, or MMG for short, is a biomedical signal that is emitted by the muscles.This signal is detected from the forearm muscles to know what hand gesture is made and fed into the computer. This was my Masters project at Mehran University.
